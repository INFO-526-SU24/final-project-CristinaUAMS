    "text": "Analysis plan\n\nAdditional data will come from: Acids in coffee: A review of sensory measurements and meta-analysis of chemical composition, by Yeager et al\n\nWhen it comes to what specific plotting method will best represent this data, it is difficult to know with certainty at this time. Anytime a correlation is made, scatterplots are an obvious choice with the possibility of facet wrapping by type.\nThere are two relevant CSVs one contains data on total levels of organic acids, known to produce the acidic qualities of coffee and another contains data on total levels of chlorogenic acids in coffee - the total amount of which is dependent on roast level and correlated (inversely) with the “bitterness” flavor profiles.\nThis data will be joined on the type of roast ( a variable in both).\nThis study provides definitive data on the levels of acidity in coffee by roast as well as a source for what causes both bitterness and acidity in taste and will be helpful in determining subjects taste accuracy.\n\nThey have quite a few very nice plots of their own, I think the one that best summarizes the data I’ll be using is:\n\nplotAcidByRoast &lt;- here(\"images/acidLevelByRoast.png\")\n\nggdraw() +\n  draw_image(plotAcidByRoast)\n\n\n\n\nImage from Yeager et al, Acids in Coffee\n\n\n\n\nThese tables will not be used in my report but are included here for informational purposes only. It shows the concentrations of total organic acids (on top) for Arabica (left) and Robusta (right) at different roast levels as well as different concentrations of CGAs for the same (bottom).\nAs discussed in their paper, CGAs form chlorogenic acid lactones during roasting which impart the bitterness into the coffee. After roasting, the CGAs are no longer present and the lactones are, giving the bitter profile. Similar bitterness occurs through breakdown resulting from other organic acid compounds.\n\nReformatting Data\nDue to some type of formatting error, roughly 1500 and 250 NA columns were appended to each dataset. Trimming those off, allows a more realistic view of the actual data names and size.\nThis new data for chlorogenic acids has the dimensions and columns:\n\n## Dimensions and columns in the chlorogenic acids dataset:\ndim(coffeeAcidityCGA[1:33])\n\n[1] 1344   33\n\n\nThe columns are called:\n\n## The columns are called:\ncolnames(coffeeAcidityCGA[1:33])\n\n [1] \"Source\"                    \"Type\"                     \n [3] \"Roast\"                     \"Extraction\"               \n [5] \"Stats\"                     \"Other\"                    \n [7] \"Units\"                     \"total CQA\"                \n [9] \"Total FQA\"                 \"Total diCQA\"              \n[11] \"3-CQA\"                     \"4-CQA\"                    \n[13] \"5-CQA\"                     \"3-FQA\"                    \n[15] \"5-pCoQA\"                   \"5-FQA\"                    \n[17] \"Ferulic Acid\"              \"4-FQA\"                    \n[19] \"3,5-diCQA\"                 \"3,4-diCQA\"                \n[21] \"4,5-DiCQA\"                 \"3-pCo,5-CQA\"              \n[23] \"3-C,4-FQA\"                 \"3-C,5-FQA\"                \n[25] \"4,5-FQA\"                   \"3-C,4-FQA and 3-pCo,4-CQA\"\n[27] \"3-C,5-DQA\"                 \"3-C,4-DQA\"                \n[29] \"3-D,5-FQA\"                 \"Nicotinic Acid\"           \n[31] \"3-CGA\"                     \"Total CGA\"                \n[33] \"Notes\"                    \n\n\nThe new data for organic acids has dimension:\n\n## The dimensions of the Organic Acids dataset is:\ndim(coffeeAcidityOA[1:33])\n\n[1] 287  33\n\n\nThat data has column names:\n\n## Those columns are called:\ncolnames(coffeeAcidityOA[1:33])\n\n [1] \"Source\"         \"Type\"           \"Roast\"          \"Extraction\"    \n [5] \"Stat\"           \"Other\"          \"Units\"          \"Citric\"        \n [9] \"Formic\"         \"Malic\"          \"Pyruvic\"        \"Quinic\"        \n[13] \"Succinic\"       \"Acetic\"         \"Oxalic\"         \"Fumaric\"       \n[17] \"Tartaric\"       \"Lactic\"         \"Glycolic\"       \"Nitric\"        \n[21] \"Mesaconic\"      \"Maleic\"         \"Isocitric\"      \"Citraconic\"    \n[25] \"Propionic\"      \"2-Furoic\"       \"Pyroglutamic\"   \"Phosphoric\"    \n[29] \"Levulinic Acid\" \"Methylsuccinic\" \"Nicotinic\"      \"Ascorbic\"      \n[33] \"Hydroxybenzoic\"\n\n\nWorking with this additional data will require that I combine these three datasets along the “roast” variable and compare the relevant variables.\nFor Organic Acids, I will need to create a new variable which adds up the total relevant organic acids. This will be a double type as it is a measure of concentration.\nIn the CGAs Table, I will similarly need to create a new variable which sums the total relevant CGAs. This will be a double type as it is a measure of concentration.\nOnce this has been done, those two variables can be compared, by roast (chr type - qualitative), against what the taste testers believed to be acidic and non acidic (chr type -qualitative).\nAfter that, I would like to run an analysis on the likelihood of a person to be correct based on their favorite coffee beverage.\nLooking at the second question, will be much more straightforward examining the political affiliation selection made by the participants as well as which of the coffees they preferred.\n\nWeekly Plan of Attack Table: Last updated: 5/28/2024\n\n\nTask Name\nStatus\nAssignee\nDue\nPriority\nSummary\n\n\n\n\nAdd any extras or polish up wording\nnot yet started\nCristina Lafuente\nJune 10, 2024\nLow\nAs possible additions *nice to haves* pop up, add them to this list\n\n\nBegin working on presentation and write up\nnot yet started\nCristina Lafuente\nJune 3, 2024\nModerate\nOnce feedback is in, begin wrangling data and working on presentation\n\n\nFinish proposal and give feedback\ncomplete\nCristina Lafuente\nWednesday, May 29: 5pm\nHigh\nPush completed proposal and complete peer review"
