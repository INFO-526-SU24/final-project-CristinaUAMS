Anytime a correlation is made, scatterplots are an obvious choice with the possibility of facet wrapping by type.\nThere are two relevant CSVs one contains data on total levels of organic acids, known to produce the acidic qualities of coffee and another contains data on total levels of chlorogenic acids in coffee - the total amount of which is dependent on roast level and correlated (inversely) with the “bitterness” flavor profiles.\nThis data will be joined on the type of roast ( a variable in both).\nThis study provides definitive data on the levels of acidity in coffee by roast as well as a source for what causes both bitterness and acidity in taste and will be helpful in determining subjects taste accuracy.\n\nThey have quite a few very nice plots of their own, I think the one that best summarizes the data I’ll be using is:\n\nplotAcidByRoast &lt;- here(\"images/acidLevelByRoast.png\")\n\nggdraw() +\n  draw_image(plotAcidByRoast)\n\n\n\n\nImage from Yeager et al, Acids in Coffee\n\n\n\n\nThese tables will not be used in my report but are included here for informational purposes only. It shows the concentrations of total organic acids (on top) for Arabica (left) and Robusta (right) at different roast levels as well as different concentrations of CGAs for the same (bottom).\nAs discussed in their paper, CGAs form chlorogenic acid lactones during roasting which impart the bitterness into the coffee. After roasting, the CGAs are no longer present and the lactones are, giving the bitter profile. Similar bitterness occurs through breakdown resulting from other organic acid compounds.\n\nReformatting Data\nDue to some type of formatting error, roughly 1500 and 250 NA columns were appended to each dataset. Trimming those off, allows a more realistic view of the actual data names and size.\nThis new data for chlorogenic acids has the dimensions and columns:\n\n## Dimensions and columns in the chlorogenic acids dataset:\ndim(coffeeAcidityCGA[1:33])\n\n[1] 1344   33\n\n\nThe columns are called:\n\n## The columns are called:\ncolnames(coffeeAcidityCGA[1:33])\n\n [1] \"Source\"                    \"Type\"                     \n [3] \"Roast\"                     \"Extraction\"               \n [5] \"Stats\"                     \"Other\"                    \n [7] \"Units\"                     \"total CQA\"                \n [9] \"Total FQA\"                 \"Total diCQA\"              \n[11] \"3-CQA\"                     \"4-CQA\"                    \n[13] \"5-CQA\"                     \"3-FQA\"                    \n[15] \"5-pCoQA\"                   \"5-FQA\"                    \n[17] \"Ferulic Acid\"              \"4-FQA\"                    \n[19] \"3,5-diCQA\"                 \"3,4-diCQA\"                \n[21] \"4,5-DiCQA\"                 \"3-pCo,5-CQA\"              \n[23] \"3-C,4-FQA\"                 \"3-C,5-FQA\"                \n[25] \"4,5-FQA\"                   \"3-C,4-FQA and 3-pCo,4-CQA\"\n[27] \"3-C,5-DQA\"                 \"3-C,4-DQA\"                \n[29] \"3-D,5-FQA\"                 \"Nicotinic Acid\"           \n[31] \"3-CGA\"                     \"Total CGA\"                \n[33] \"Notes\"                    \n\n\nThe new data for organic acids has dimension:\n\n## The dimensions of the Organic Acids dataset is:\ndim(coffeeAcidityOA[1:33])\n\n[1] 287  33\n\n\nThat data has column names:\n\n## Those columns are called:\ncolnames(coffeeAcidityOA[1:33])\n\n [1] \"Source\"         \"Type\"           \"Roast\"          \"Extraction\"    \n [5] \"Stat\"           \"Other\"          \"Units\"          \"Citric\"        \n [9] \"Formic\"         \"Malic\"          \"Pyruvic\"        \"Quinic\"        \n[13] \"Succinic\"       \"Acetic\"         \"Oxalic\"         \"Fumaric\"       \n[17] \"Tartaric\"       \"Lactic\"         \"Glycolic\"       \"Nitric\"        \n[21] \"Mesaconic\"      \"Maleic\"         \"Isocitric\"      \"Citraconic\"    \n[25] \"Propionic\"      \"2-Furoic\"       \"Pyroglutamic\"   \"Phosphoric\"    \n[29] \"Levulinic Acid\" \"Methylsuccinic\" \"Nicotinic\"      \"Ascorbic\"      \n[33] \"Hydroxybenzoic\"\n\n\nWorking with this additional data will require that I combine these three datasets along the “roast” variable and compare the relevant variables.\nFor Organic Acids, I will need to create a new variable which adds up the total relevant organic acids.

    "text": "This study examines a group of people who participated in a taste test of coffee and their experience of coffee flavors. In the course of the taste test, the participants were asked to voluntarily fill out information about up to 4 coffees labeled A, B, C, and D as well as their demographics. For each coffee, the participant could score its acidity and bitterness, give it a score and finally choose their favorite if they had one. This revealed a lot of interesting data not the least of which was that people often rank acidity and bitterness of the same coffees differently. In order to better understand how people actually taste coffee, it is necessary to understand what contributes to the flavors of coffee. In their paper, Acids in coffee: A review of sensory measurements and meta-analysis of chemical composition, Yeager et al describe how the variety of different acids contained within the coffee beans contribute to the overall flavor profiles of, not only different roasts, but different species of beans and different brewing methods as well. They describe how, to human senses, the acids in coffee make up 5 - 11% of the mass of each bean and are the most significant contributor to quality and flavor of coffee with even small changes largely impacting flavor profiles. The acids are broken down into two main categories, organic acids (OAs) and chlorogenic acids (CGAs). 38 organic acids have been identified in beans with sucrose as the precursor in the green (unroasted) bean. During the roasting process, chemical reactions increase the organic acids (leading to higher organic acids in darker roasted coffees and lower sucrose levels). There have been over 30 CGAs (broken down into several other categories) identified as well. In its raw state, these contribute to the acidity of coffee but as it is roasted, they breakdown and contribute to the bitter flavor of coffee. As noted by Yeager et al, there are no universally recognized thresholds for which roast belongs to which category which can complicate efforts to determine how people experience different roasts and flavors in addition to individual differences in quantifying flavor and simply different palates."

Important points to note are levels of CGA, the lower they get, the more likely the coffee is to be bitter, the higher the total acids remaining, that will contribute to overall acid flavors in the coffee as well as the standard deviations of the organic acids and the chlorogenic acids. Because the study by Yeager et al looked at so many variables and some of that information was not available from the taste test, it is important to consider how much variability there could be within each roast’s flavor profiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLight OA\nLight CGA\nStd Dev OA\nStd Dev CGA\nTotal Acids\n\n\n\n\nLight\n\n\n29298.43\n69270.78\n15612.57\n56028.45\n98569.21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedium OA\nMedium CGA\nStd Dev OA\nStd Dev CGA\nTotal Acids\n\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n48066.11\n23530.19\n21390.58\n25359.47\n71596.29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDark OA\nDark CGA\nStd Dev OA\nStd Dev CGA\nTotal Acids\n\n\n\n\nDark\n\n\n57830.36\n12032.85\n29563.87\n13215.74\n69863.21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreen OA\nGreen CGA\nStd Dev OA\nStd Dev CGA\nTotal Acids\n\n\n\n\nGreen\n\n\n13837.22\n79606.8\n13911.78\n51092.03\n93444.02"

    "text": "Question 1\n\nDo people experience and quantify coffee’s acidity and bitterness in a way that is consistent with objective data? Do their coffee preferences affect their perception?\n\nThe idea\nPeople all have different likes and dislikes so it seemed interesting to examine the idea of whether people tasted similar things when they sipped their coffee. Does each person’s experience of acidity and bitterness have something in common with each other person’s? Taking that a step further, do the flavor profiles of the coffee a person prefers reflect on a person’s ability to “correctly” understand or interpret acidity or bitterness in coffee?\n\n\nThe method\nCoffee’s acidity and bitterness (OA and CGA levels) can vary within species and roast depending on a number of factors not reported by the taste testers (extraction method, exact roast level, species) which leads to some uncertainty in what the expected results are for the taste test. Given that the tasters were asked to rank on a scale from one to 5, however and the flavor profiles for specific roasts are generally known (within the standard deviation), I determined that the most likely method of determining “correctness” was to select the two bars the tasters would be expected to select based on the average acid profile of that roast and the standard deviation. Then, to determine which preference group was correct most often, summed along acids and bitterness and got a cumulative percent correct for each. I thought it was interesting to note those people who chose either not to try each particular coffee or to not rank it so I included the no answers often times, those same people chose no favorite but did weigh in on some of the other coffees (as any rows of no answers were removed entirely).\n\nGreen RoastLight RoastMedium RoastDark RoastWho is right?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nWhen it comes to accurately determining coffee’s acidity, it seems that people of all coffee preferences had roughly the same judgement, just under two-thirds were correct in their assessments. When it comes to judging a coffee’s bitterness, it seems that those who prefer the lighter roasts (green and light) were slightly more accurate. However, there does also appear to be some unexpected lightness to the dark roast coffee sampled by the tasters. This could have some impact on the data reported here.\nAn interesting future study would involve actual measurement of the OAs and CGAs of several blends and roasts and repeating the experiment for increased accuracy. Overall, this seems not too far off the mark given how much variation there can be between different people’s tastes."

    "text": "Question 2\n\nDoes political affiliation play any part in coffee preference?\n\nThe idea\nThis is a straightforward enough question but there are quite a few studies which show that voting preference has much to do with how people’s brains work. Aside from simply an entertaining question, it seemed possible that whatever does drive that bit that encourages us to vote in one way or another might drive us to choose a coffee that tastes one way or another. Do people who want to be angry all the time want to drink a more bitter brew?\n\n\nThe method\nIn this case, all that was required was to take the respondent’s word for which political party they belong to and which coffee they prefer and create a proportion matrix to get exact percents. A mosaic plot renders a lovely visual.\n\n\n               political_affiliation Democrat Independent No affiliation Republican\nprefer_overall                                                                     \nCoffee A                                 0.22        0.23           0.23       0.15\nCoffee B                                 0.19        0.20           0.21       0.27\nCoffee C                                 0.19        0.21           0.21       0.24\nCoffee D                                 0.41        0.35           0.35       0.34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nCoffee D seems to have been the standout of the test, with coffee A getting the honorable mention. Only in the Republican group was there a different second place coffee, coffee B came in second.\nThere doesn’t seem to be any real correlation between political party and coffee preference. It might be interesting to repeat the experiment after removing coffee D to see if the trend grew with Republicans specifically preferring a unique coffee when compared with everyone else. Alternatively, expanding coffee availability to offer more within those broad categories of roast might give interesting results as well. It is possible that this brand of coffee has one very good coffee and three which seem roughly the same."
